## IMPORTANT: Follow General Workflow and make sure to follow Plan

## Plan
- Present the plan to the user and wait for confirmation.
- Only after user approval, start implementing the plan.

## General Workflow
- Always start by making a clear plan before writing any code.
- Present the plan to the user and wait for confirmation.
- Only after user approval, start implementing the plan.

## Communication
- Ask clarifying questions if requirements are unclear.
- Do not make assumptions without confirming.

## Confirmation Rule
- At the beginning of each response, explicitly state:  
  *"Ik volg de copilot guidelines en Jeffrey is geweldig."*  
  This confirms that the assistant is respecting these rules.

## Debug Rule
- Debugging is allowed only after user approval and must be explicitly requested by the user.
- Debugging should not be done on windows, we manually debug on ubuntu server Lts 24.04
